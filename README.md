# reinvent-the-wheel
A learning experience composed of attempts to implement popular algorithms, structures, patterns and protocols.

### Algorithms (C/C++)
- TODO: **External Sorting** (k-way merge sort)
  - optimize selection of the with a binary heap
    - use `perf` for performance profiling to measure if the optimization is worth it

### Artificial Intelligence (Python)
- TODO: **Neural Network**
  - optimization with Gradient Descent
  - linear regression with least squares method

### Concurrent Programming (C/C++)
- TODO: **Producer-Consumer Problem**

Nice to have - protocols, design patterns.
